# Multilingual Sentiment Analysis

This project explores the effectiveness of language-agnostic models for sentiment analysis, particularly focusing on sentiment expressed in Hindi text. It addresses the challenges in analyzing sentiment across languages and aims to provide insights into the robustness and accuracy of various pre-trained models.

## Introduction

The digital landscape generates vast amounts of user-generated content in diverse languages, including Hindi. Accurately understanding the sentiment expressed in these diverse voices unlocks valuable insights for various applications. However, analyzing sentiment across languages presents unique challenges, particularly for non-dominant languages like Hindi.

## Features

- Addressing resource scarcity in Hindi sentiment analysis
- Overcoming limitations of existing sentiment analysis solutions
- Providing qualitative assessment methods for evaluating model robustness
- Enhancing customer insights and social media analysis in Hindi
